            <div class="title">The Legacy of the SimbianCraft series of realms and servers</div>
            <div class="title">Our Beginnings</div>
            <div class="text">All the way back on December 17th 2019 SimbianCraft started as a successor of Whaly Whale's Free Survival Realm, inheriting its style and most of its player base. Our second season was a soft reset with the same builds but a different location and world. The third season of SimbianCraft has shifted to nations and officially adopted the SimbianCraft name.</div>
            <div class="title">SimbianCraft becomes New Championcraft</div>
            <div class="text">Around the same time a realm named ChampionCraft that had branched off Whaly Whale's Free Survival Realm, was ending as well thus New Championcraft was created which succeeded both SimbianCraft and ChampionCraft tho unofficially at first. The first New Championcraft season was 3.5 released on August 22nd 2020 which was a short season but during that time I tried to figure out the cancelled kingdoms concept from ChampionCraft, a few weeks later New Championcraft 4 released which had 4 kingdoms that would constantly fight for land but unfortunately that idea flopped, though during that period Chaamp10n the former owner of ChampionCraft had declared New Championcraft as a canon part of its timeline.</div>
            <div class="title">The time we almost ended</div>
            <div class="text">Due to the flop of season 4 I figured I would try one more time to capture success with a new season, and if it failed it would have been the last season. So i held a seed vote by giving players 5 choices and picked the winner to become the seed of season 5, on November 21st 2020 it released as an SMP realm followed by a lot of advertising on reddit, though shortly after I had a battle with Tricky Scrappy and since he won the real became a nations realm with a concept similar to ChampionCraft 2 but expanded upon.  This perhaps had turned our realm for the better since during the entirety of the season the discord server grew from about 30 members all the way up to 450 or so. Season 5 was also the longest season ever up untill GreenCraft SMP and is regarded to be one of the best seasons of our timeline.</div>
            <div class="title">Another attempt at SMP</div>
            <div class="text">After season 5 ended in march, New Championcraft 6 was released which followed the SMP style of older seasons like SimbianCraft 1 and Championcraft 1, but since many players were used to the Nations style from the last season we introduced unions which were sort of nations but not really. otherwise season 6 performed a little bit worse but that was kind of expected since we came from the massive success of season 5.</div>
            <div class="title">The weird experiments</div>
            <div class="text">In June New Championcraft 6 had ended and was replaced by a server but since at the time I did not have resources for a paid server we settled with a free one which was not good, either way New Championcraft 6.5 started as a sky block servers separate for Java and Bedrock editions of all things though it didn't last long since it was replaced by New Championcraft 7 which had both editions combined into one cross play server still free and the sky block concept was not abandoned as it was remade into New Championcraft Skyblock 1 which existed along side season 7. But since these servers were free they had a lot of problems and limitations so it was soon replaced</div>
            <div class="title">Back on track</div>
            <div class="text">After the disaster that New Championcraft 6.5 and 7 made we released New Championcraft 8, its seed was once again chosen with a seed vode and happend to be the same as ChampionCraft 2, season 8 also shared a nearly identical concept of nations as ChampionCraft 2 as well as its spawn was made sort of similarly to it as well. New Championcraft 8 also had ice highways which was kind of a wierd decition but it was cool and it made travel to farther regions easy, the only bad thing about season 8 was that the players were sometimes destructive. New Championcraft 8 also introduced Collectable Maps which were sort of a version of pokemon cards that players could collect and then later exchange for diamonds, with the maps value increasing ad time went on. In general season 8 picked up where season 6 left of and brought back nations and made us popular again.</div>
            <div class="title">Return of Kingdoms</div>
            <div class="text">After the success of season 8 I decided that it was time to try kingdoms again, this time i reimagined them where there was only 2 kingdoms that would share a border and both of them would fight each other but that concept wasn't that popular with the player base to they just lived on their own, somewhere around the same time New Championcraft Skyblock 2 was also released which followed the footsteps of Skyblock 1 though it was originally planned to be integrated into New Championcraft 9 but wasnt due to a lack of tools to do so at the time. New Championcraft 9 did not last that long tho since it wasn't performing well but before the end Project New Summer was announced as supposedly new season that would be the ending of New Championcraft. After season 9 ended work on the project began and in the meantime  players were directed to Sonny's Legacy in the meantime</div>
            <div class="title">New Championcraft 5... Again</div>
            <div class="text">About a month later, on November 21st 2021 actually New Championcraft 9.5 was released because I thought that having an 8 month gap between seasons wasn't a good idea though since i was still working on Project New Summer I implemented a rule that if the realm didn't meet the number of active players in a week it would end prematurely, that rule was never broken so the realm continued to exist, New Championcraft 9.5 was a nations realm with a similar version of nations that New Championcraft 8 had. With season 9.5 I noticed that many of the older players had stopped playing and were slowly replaced by the new players that joined. Around the same time i carried an expiriment with SimbianCraft 4 (also refered as New Championcraft 9.4) but that didnt work. Also on December 31st 2021 Project New Summer was revealed with a name New Championcraft X (spoken: New Championcraft 10)</div>
            <div class="title">New Championcraft 6... Again, but with a twist</div>
            <div class="text">On February 14th 2022 New Championcraft 9.6 was released originally planned as a replica of season 6 like season 9.5 was to 5 but later it was decided to have a world border and brought back Collectable Maps from season 8 but with a new look. Towns were its playstyle which kind of mashed together Nations and SMP into one and due to its small world size it worked quite well as it made players work together, not without consequences though. The addons were brought back from season 6 and upgraded with new features thanks to Flipswap. Collectable Maps also gained a new used as they now could be used to expand the world border or traded in for Champ Bucks which was a new currency we had created. this season also fulfilled my dream to own a Town like realm like ChampionCraft 1 or Whaly Whale's Free Survival realm as the season was coming to an end a lot of conflicts started to show up between members of diffrent towns but since the activity was dropping a new season was created. Also this season was onece again one of the best ever, it also finally had New Championcraft Skyblock 3 integrated as a part of its world as well</div>
            <div class="title">New Championcraft 7... Not again</div>
            <div class="text">on May 28th 2022 New Championcarft 9.7 was created as a short filler season between season 9.6 and 10. It's length didn't stop players though as it was bursting with activity following the same style of season 9.6 but now without the border players could freely live anywhere but some still chose to live near spawn, It also had only 6 collectable maps that were unique to this season, but season 10 came so quick that there wasn't time for anything major to happen. It also had the shopping town and New Championcraft Skyblock 3 carried over to it</div>
            <div class="title">And finally, the pyramids align, or do they?</div>
            <div class="text">As previously announced New Championcraft X started on June 16th 2022, featuring New Championcraft Skyblock 4 and due to popular demand New Championcraft Earth 1, Since New Championcraft X was planned to be the final season it also had a small copy of its older siblings to show how far we have come. Primarily season 10 was a nations realm but earth SMP quickly overtook it so there was no nations, since it was built on top of the base of New Championcraft 8 it shared the same seed and it had ice highways as well, There were also a little corner of spawn created for shops though there wasnt many. For the first month and a half season was going pretty well but late July a lot of hackers started joining so the realms member list was purged but on July 24th and 25th our discord server were nuked by non other than Malefic  and his little helper Hark and due to all that happening a big part of our players were kicked from the nukes or left the realm but the realm kept on going, with some additional controversies until it ended ahead of its planned ending date of October 16th on August 22nd 2022 and that decision was made because season 10 was already ruined and I didn't thing that ending it in a good was was possible. </div>
            <div class="title">The New begging</div>
            <div class="text">After the big mess that was season 10 New Championcraft 11 was created which was a short lasting realm with a world border and many of the features of season 9.6, since it was created after a catastrophe it wasn't popular but it proved that we can keep going.</div>
            <div class="title">The last hooray  </div>
            <div class="text">After season 11 we brought back nations and most of the season 9s spawn to New Championcraft 12 which is considered our last successful season. It had many staples like Collectable Maps, Ruins and more, but it lacked the addons from before, unfortunately the hackers kept coming and since I was already exhausted from the events of season 10 I decided to end the season almost 2 months later and directed players to join Peculiar SMP even though i already announced season 13 I said the end was permanent even though it wasn't</div>
            <div class="title">The begining of the end</div>
            <div class="text">As announced New Championcraft 13 released on December 23rd 2022, with a seed vote, season 9.6 seed won so its spawn was built in the exact same spot as 9.6, this season had minigames and New Championcraft Earth 2 but unlike in season 10 the earth SMP didn't take off and the realm itself was inactive so a new season was quickly started, originally planned to be called New Cahmpioncraft 13.5 season 14 didn't have any additional content except Collectable Maps and used all the assets from older seasons, but it also didn't work so it also ended quite quick</div>
            <div class="title">The end</div>
            <div class="text">In the mean time of those flopping season we were working on a bigger project that later got turned into a Java server and so on April 20th 2023 New Championcraft 15 was released which was a Java and Bedrock Cross play server tho since it was also my first time working on a server many things werent introduced like shops and New Championcraft Earth 3 or were poorly set up like spawn and crates and it is the shortest season along side season 6.5 lasting only 16 days as pretty much no new players joined so it ended on May 6th</div>
            <div class="title">A rebrand</div>
            <div class="text">After a while I decided to try again with a new realm with a new name and new staff system to prevent accidents from happening again. thus on September 15th 2023 CaveCraft SMP was created, it featured an anti cheat and only the tiles addon from old seasons, unlike the late New Championcraft seasons it gained a little bit of traction, as CaveCraft SMP promised to host events every 2 weeks the first event was the boat event which remixed old ice boat events into one, though after a lot of marketing the event didn't have any actual participants which put me in a tiny bit of a depression making me end the season a bit too early that I wanted to.</div>
            <div class="title">From private server to Project Green</div>
            <div class="text">On January 2024 I was thinking about creating a private server where me, my friends and maybe some of the old players would be able to play, but quickly plans started to grow and out grow the project to where having a public server would be better so in February work on a new Project green began, since I went to Italy for Erasmus I talked a lot in my discord server since I didn't have any friends there, eventually one of the members there Ignas decided to join the team and thus development restarted in march as he owned a server before he knew his way around plugins, though there was another guy named Sevo  that wanted to merge our server into his which at first seemed convincing but as it later turned out he was essentially wanting to take us over so we resisted and moved on.</div>
            <div class="title">From Project Green to GreenCraft SMP</div>
            <div class="text">When I came back home the work on this server sped up and the first trailer was released revealing it and its planned features, and as time moved on and more features were added in more trailers were released and in the minigames trailer unveiled the final name to be GreenCraft SMP but a few of the other names were Project Green SMP and CaveCraft SMP 2. As the release date came closer and the server was going closer to the finish line a few conflicts about NPCs, Shops, Ranks and other stuff came since for example Ignas wanted ranks to be like VIP, MVP... and i wanted them to be like Peculiar SMP had them for example Merchant going all the way to Champion. Either way as Paper 1.21 released the server released as well</div>
            <div class="title">The time we actually ended</div>
            <div class="text">As all you now know that GreenCraft SMP is pretty much ended now beacause it was inactive, but thats beacause if it would have been active there would have been GreenCraft SMP 2 and so on similarly like New Championcraft 5 was. Anyway Greencraft SMP began kind of meh but after a few weeks it became quite active with its peak being 9 online players, though the little did I know that that was the last success that i will see out of it and it only lasted a week. I tried to keep the server active with weekly content drops and events every 2 weeks but that didn't work, and the server lasted 5 months all because I wanted to give it a solid try  though after 2.5 months I slowly started giving up on it as I saw it was going nowhere.</div>
            <div class="title">The present</div>
            <div class="text">Ever since the destruction of season 10 I wanted to give my realms/servers an ending they deserved but the 5 years of SimbianCraft event on December 17th 2024 was perhaps the only way that I could sort of do it, and I did it by having the spawns of popular seasons turned into a large boat race. This mat not have been the ending that I imagined but at this point it is good enough</div>
            <div class="title">The Future </div>
            <div class="text">As the server closes down on December 27th 2024 it will close down forever and after this I will not make another season related to this timeline in any way. and as for now I like to say Thanks for everyone that played my servers or realms and well Goodbye as I wont make another server for quite a whiiiiiile if ever. I wont disappear though and if yall have any questions, I will host a QnA over here soon with a possible video coming out too. Either way...</div>
            <div class="title">Thanks for playing everyone</div>
